# knn
A simple implementation of kNN / k nearest neighbour classification algorithm for demonstration purposes only.

There is a file called random_points_generator.py which generates a file called points.png 

This image contains red and green dots each spread across a random plane. And black sqaures spread randomly throughout the image.

# Intructions:

step 1: execute random_points_generator.py
	this generates points.png

step 2: execute knn.py
	this overrides points.png classifying all the black squares.
